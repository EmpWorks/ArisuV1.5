# Arisu Keyboard PCB
アリス PCB designed using KiCad. The layout is inspired by Lyn's EM7 and TGR Alice with some modification of my own.

### Disclaimer
This board is a heavily-modified FateNozomi arisu-pcb While the schematic, basic layout etc is essentially the same, it supports additional features like Hot-swap,USB-C etc.

Key differences:
- supports hotswap PCB sockets
- added WS2812B Smd Led footprint for backlit 
- encoder support
- supports atmega32u4 MU/AU
- USB-C compatibility
